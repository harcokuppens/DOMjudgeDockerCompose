USAGE="Usage: $(basename "$0") [OPTIONS] FILEPATH

Get an unique checksum for the backup a MariaDB database.

Description:
  This script computes a SHA256 checksum for a given MariaDB database
  dump file (gzipped). The checksum is calculated in a way that ignores certain
  tables that may contain frequently changing data, such as timestamps
  or logs, which are not essential for detecting changes in the main data.
  By excluding these tables, the checksum focuses on the core data of the
  database, making it more reliable for identifying significant changes.  
  This is particularly useful for backup verification and integrity checks,
  as it helps to avoid false positives due to irrelevant data changes. 
  The script reads the dump file, removes the data for the specified tables,
  and then computes the SHA256 checksum of the remaining content.
  The resulting checksum can be used to verify the integrity of the backup
  or to compare different backups to see if the main data has changed.
  Latter is used in the mariadb-rollinb-backup script to discard equivalent 
  backups. In the mariadb-restore-backup script the checksum is used to verify
  the integrity of the backup before restoring it.


Options:
  -e, --exclude-tables-in-checksum TABLES
                Comma separated list of tables to exclude from checksum calculation
                (default: none)
  -h, --help    Display this help message and exit.

Arguments:
  FILEPATH      The path of the database dump file."
